CONTENTS:

crackcount_1.py: basic machine learning algorithm script for predicting cracks
plot_digits_classification.py: the classic digits machine learning script. used as a reference for modelling crackcount_1

Data:images and traces used in crackcount_1.py
  B: base images with only blue (no green or red), leftover data from an earlier version of crackcount_1.py
  Base: base outcrop images, labelled base0 to base[n-1], where n is the total number of images
  Trace: images of traces of cracks for each base image, labelled trace0 to trace[n-1]
